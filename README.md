## 📋 Process Overview
We use **Kanban** to manage our work. The board helps us see what’s in progress, limit overload, and finish tasks faster.

**Principles we follow:**
1. Visualize all work.
2. Limit work-in-progress (WIP).
3. Keep tasks moving left → right until “Done”.
4. Continuously improve as a team.
